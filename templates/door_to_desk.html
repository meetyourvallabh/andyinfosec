                    <p>We call it Door to Desk as we test your Physical Environment/ Premises of your organization from the Entry gate to Employees Desk. It is called as Red Team Security Testing.</p>
                    <p>To put red teaming in layman’s terms, it’s “ethical hacking” a way for independent security teams to test how well an organization would fare in the face of a real attack.</p>
                    <p>Red Teaming is a full-scope, multi-layered attack simulation designed to measure how well a company’s people and networks, applications and physical security controls can withstand an attack from a real-life adversary.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>A thorough red team test will expose vulnerabilities and risks regarding:</b>
                        <li><b>Technology : </b>Networks, applications, routers, switches, appliances, etc.</li>
                        <li><b>People : </b>Staff,independentcontractors,departments,businesspartners,etc.</li>
                        <li><b>Physical : </b>Offices, warehouses, substations, data centers, buildings, etc.</li>
                    </p>
                    <p>The premise of red teaming is comparable to the old sports saying, ‘the best offense is a good defense’. Red teaming helps a business remain competitive while securing its business interests by leveraging social engineering and physical, application and network penetration testing to find ways to shore up your defenses.</p>
                    <p>During a red team engagement, highly trained security consultants enact attack scenarios to reveal potential physical, hardware, software and human vulnerabilities. Red team engagements also identify opportunities for bad actors and malicious insiders to compromise company systems and networks or enable data breaches.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Who Needs It?</h4>
                    <p>If you’re a small to midsize businesses, you might think red teaming isn’t for you. “I’m too small to be a target,” you might theorize. But in fact, this is exactly the line of thinking that puts an organization at risk. If you were a bad actor, wouldn’t you want to go after the guy who’d never expect it?</p>
                    <p>While you might think no one would care enough to hack into your company, businesses of all sizes and individuals are regularly victimized.
                            And it’s not just about sensitive information. Bad actors are also trying to take over the technologies that power our lives. For instance, they might be looking to access your network to better hide their activities while taking over another system or network somewhere else in the world. Your data doesn’t matter. It’s your computers they want to infect with malicious software so that they add your system to a botnet group.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h4>How Red Teaming Helps?</h4>
                    <p>Red teaming isn’t just about finding the holes in your defense. To continue the sports analogy, a good red team engagement will also provide a playbook to improve that defense in the future.</p>
                    <p>Effective red teaming operations don’t end with the discovery phase. You want to work with a red team consultant that offers remediation assistance and re- testing. After all, the real legwork happens in the weeks or even months of effort it takes after our initial engagement to implement remediation controls.</p>
                    <p>Instead of moving on as soon as the ink dries on the final report, work with a penetration testing team that provides ongoing support to ensure your business fully comprehends the findings (impact, likelihood, criticality) and is on the right track toward remediation.</p>
                    <p>For example, our clients often contact us for remediation guidance well after we hand them their report and present our findings. And we encourage this! Red Team provides remediation assistance at no additional fee because the true value of our service is in helping close your security loop, not just reporting your weaknesses.</p>
                    <p>Red Team Security offers full-force red teaming addressing cyber-attacks, social engineering, and physical security in testing threat profiles. This means comprehensive testing of your business’s technical landscape as well as fully testing your people and physical security controls.</p>
